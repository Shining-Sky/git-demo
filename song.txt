I want to be cruisin' on the bay
I want to be cruisin' like Nemo
No money but I wanna go far away
I don't have money but I wanna relax
No money but I wanna eat Jiro Ono's sushi

Worked hard to get my pay, yeah
Gonna spend it all on my stomach
Pinching pennies to spend it all on wasting it
Leave me be, even if I overspend
Even if I break apart my savings tomorrow
Like a crazy guy

Ooh, there's no tomorrow
There's already a mortgage on my future (Mortgage)
Ooh, spending my money even more
Friends, what's up?
Do you want some? (Want some?)
