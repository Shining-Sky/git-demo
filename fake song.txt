Oh my love we've had
Our share of tears
Oh my friends we've had
Our hopes and fears
Oh my friend it's been
A long hard year
But now it's Christmas
Yes it's Christmas
Thank God it's Christmas

The master of my sea, oh-ooh
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses

The moon and stars
Seem awful cold and bright
Let's hope the snow will
Make this Christmas right
